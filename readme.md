# ðŸš€ Getting Started

First of all I assumed that the input file will be valid as I've not added any validation for the file.
## Quick Start
To run this project you should have nodejs installed on your computer and then clone this repository into your computer using this command
```sh
git clone https://github.com/mohsinayoob/file-reading-test.git
```


## ðŸŽ¯ Simple Run
Open terminal to the project repository.

I used two npm packages for file reading that's why you are required to run this command once
``` 
npm i
````
For each time you want to convert asv (Arrow Separated file to JSON), you need to run this command  

``` 
npm run test
````
